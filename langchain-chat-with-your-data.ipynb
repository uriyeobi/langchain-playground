Morgan Asset Management  65We are not explicitly forecasting items such as an economic \\nequilibrium rate (R*, an unobservable real cash rate that is \\nneither expansionary nor contractionary). While our view on \\nwhere R* will settle is very important, central bank policymakers \\nset nominal cash rates and will differ from R* depending on \\ntheir monetary policy stance. For example, over the last decade, \\ncentral banks have spent much more time below what would be \\nconsidered the economic neutral rate than above it.\\nWe are also not explicitly forecasting a terminal rate, the \\nhighest cash rate a central bank will achieve, although, of \\ncourse, our view on terminal rates will play an important role in \\ndetermining our forecasts for average yields and the slope of \\nthe curve.\\nNormalization and sensitivity analysis \\nUnlike our previous set of assumptions of the last 10 years, we \\nno longer see normalization as a drag on long-term returns.', metadata={'source': 'docs/ltcma-full-report.pdf', 'page': 64})"
